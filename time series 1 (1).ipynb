    "A time series is a sequence of data points collected or recorded over time, typically at regular intervals. Time series analysis involves studying the patterns, trends, and behaviors within the data to make predictions or derive insights. Common applications include finance (stock prices), weather forecasting, sales forecasting, and signal processing."
